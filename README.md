## WHY AN MOBILE APP?


#### In today's world, people using smart phones have increased rapidly and hence, a smart phone can be used efficiently for personal security or various other protection purposes.




## WHY TO USE THIS APP ?


#### The name of the application is “Raksha”. An individual equipped with the app will never feel alone and unsafe whenever they set out of their homes. 

#### Whenever an individual feels insecure, this app can be activated by a single click. 

#### A single click on this app identifies the location of the user through GPS and sends a message containing the location to the registered contacts and also a call to the first "112" which is an emergency number to help the one in a dangerous situation. 

#### The app sends the message to the registered contacts.

#### We added an feature in it for the people WHO CAN'T SPEAK. It starts shouting for help from surroundings.

#### If user wants to notify their dear ones about their location apart from SMS, they can share it through many different platforms(eg. WhatsApp , Instagram, Facebook, Email, etc) in a SINGLE CLICK.
