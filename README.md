Designing an Android based application for Safety of Women in India

Background:

In today's world, people using smart phones have increased rapidly and hence, a smart phone can be used efficiently
for personal security or various other protection purposes. 

The name of the application is “Raksha”.   A woman equipped with the app will never feel alone and unsafe whenever 
they set out of their homes. Whenever a woman feels insecure, this app can be activated by a single click. A single 
click on this app identifies the location of the user through GPS and sends a message containing the location to 
the registered contacts and also a call to the first registered/police contact to help the one in a dangerous 
situation. The app sends the message to the registered contacts every 5 minutes until it receives a response. 
The unique feature of our app is that it alerts the user whenever they enter a location notorious for crimes. 
It does so, by analyzing the police records over the past 2 years and the time of the crimes as well. 
Continuous location tracking information via SMS helps to find the location of the victim quickly and can be rescued safely.

Need for the project:

Women safety is a very big concern in a country like India where women are playing a crucial role in each and every field.
India is a peace loving country and one of the safe destination for the tourists across the world. However, a few incidents
in recent past brings to attention that there is a need for women safety. Many women’s in developed countries still fear to
go outside alone due to number of cases of violence against women. To make women safety safer many attempts have been made
but, still a safer and secure system is needed that can ensure safety during public transport and in general.

According to the statistics, it is found that every two out of three women have suffered trauma in the year 2016.
According to the survey of women, it is found that women are losing their confidence because of such incidents. 
By the survey of Delhi government’s Women and Child Development Department, around 80% of the women in national 
capital have fear regarding their safety. This motivates us to develop an app for the security of women. 

Functionalities: 

i). Allows customization: If the user relocates to another city, away from friends / family, then the application enables 
the user update the contact list.

ii). Notifies the user about risky zones: Since, the app can access the police database it can guide the user to choose a safe
path to reach their destination at a given time. If the application detects that the user is headed towards a zone with a
high crime rate, then it sends a warning notification on the user’s phone and also suggests an alternative path.

iii). Eliminates Clicks: All the user needs to do is press the “Emergency” button when the need arises.


Proposed System:

i). When the application is first clicked, it checks whether the GPS, data connection are ON or not.

ii). The application displays an ‘Emergency’ button to the user. If tapped, a message containing the present location
of the user is sent to the contact numbers inputted during the registration process as well as the police.

iii). If no response is received within the first 5 minutes, then it gives a call to the first registered contact and 
the police.
